# üéµ Music Discovery Project (Desktop + Web)

Welcome to the Music Discovery App, a comprehensive application designed to help users explore new music through a powerful and intuitive interface. This project features two distinct user experiences: a modern desktop GUI and a feature-rich web application, both powered by the Last.fm API. The web app is enhanced with AI-powered playlist summaries using Google's Gemini AI and is deployed to the cloud via a full CI/CD pipeline.

The application requires a Last.fm API key to function.

-   Navigate to **[https://www.last.fm/api/account/create](https://www.last.fm/api/account/create)**.
-   Fill out the application form to receive your personal **API Key**.

2. Configure the Project
- Open the music_app.py file.
- Locate the API_KEY variable at the top of the file.
- Replace the placeholder string "YOUR_API_KEY" with the key you obtained.

# In music_app.py
